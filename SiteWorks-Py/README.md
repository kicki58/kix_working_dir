# SiteWorks-Py
Python interface for Siteworks databases

Will only run on **32-bit Python** (tested on 3.11) because of limitations in the Firebird client lib and **FDB - The Python driver for Firebird**

Firebird client lib is included in the resources folder and the script should find it automatically

## Usage

python firebirdSW.py -c [PATH_TO_CONFIG]\siteworkspy.yml

See comments in *siteworkspy.yml* for a description of detailed usage
